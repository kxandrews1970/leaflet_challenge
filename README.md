# leaflet_challenge

Leaflet challenge utilizes java script and html with map layers.  Street maps are from openstreetmap.org (// * URL of the API to geoData
let geoData = "https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson";
// * URL to the tacktonicplates Data
let tectonicData = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json";

Starting out, I was not a fan of js.  I am still not.  I can read a js file now so that I am impressed with.  I am still starting out looking at blank script needing nudges in the right direction.  I had this working last week but tonight it isn't.  So right now i am sending what I got and will try to fix it tomorrow.  i swear it was working with the maps. I will think of it tomorrow around 3 am.  i will resubmit when i get it figured out.
